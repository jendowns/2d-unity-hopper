# 2d-unity-hopper
This 2D Unity game is a recreation of the classic Frogger arcade game.
Instead of "Frogger," it's called "Hopper," because you play as a cute bunny trying to cross road and a river.

Right now, the game is fully playable and functional. 
I will be adding a link to this game once I clean up the sprite animations.
